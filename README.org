* Cl-Sat  - Common Lisp API to Boolean SAT Solvers

This library does not provide actual implementation to each solver instance.

Rather, it just provides an interface function `solve` and other special variables.



** Dependencies

This library is at least tested on implementation listed below:

+ SBCL 1.3.5 on X86-64 Linux  3.19.0-59-generic (author's environment)

Also, it depends on the following libraries:

+ trivia by Masataro Asai ::
    NON-optimized pattern matcher compatible with OPTIMA, with extensible optimizer interface and clean codebase

+ alexandria by  ::
    Alexandria is a collection of portable public domain utilities.

+ iterate by  ::
